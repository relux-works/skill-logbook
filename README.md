# Logbook (Codex Skill)

Keeps a persistent `LOGBOOK.md` in your project root as high-signal institutional memory (findings, decisions, root causes, regressions).

## Usage

- Mention `logbook` with entry text to record an event (the skill formats it with a date header, timestamp, and tags).
- Mention `logbook review` to summarize the current logbook without writing a new entry.

See `SKILL.md` for the full rules and entry format.
